librewolf-void
==============
Void does not accept browser forks in void-packages, so this repository
provides prebuilt packages for librewolf.

Installing
----------
There are two options: use the repository for automatic updates, or install
the package manually with each release.

* Option 1. Repository
Create the file `/etc/xbps.d/20-librewolf.conf` with the following content:
repository=https://github.com/index-0/librewolf-void/releases/latest/download/

Lastly, install with:
# xbps-install -Su librewolf

* Option 2. Manual installation
Download a release (*.xbps) into an empty folder, then run:
$ cd <folder>
$ xbps-rindex -a librewolf-<version>_<revision>.<arch>.xbps
# xbps-install -R $PWD librewolf

Building
--------
Clone `void-packages` and bootstrap:
$ git clone https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages
$ cd void-packages
$ ./xbps-src binary-bootstrap

Clone this repository and copy the `librewolf-void/srcpkgs/librewolf` folder
into `void-packages/srcpkgs`, then run:
$ ./xbps-src pkg librewolf

Lastly, install with:
# xbps-install -R hostdir/binpkgs librewolf

Note:
If your `void-packages` or bootstrap is stale, update first:
$ cd void-packages
$ git pull origin master
$ ./xbps-src bootstrap-update

Integrity
---------
The build process is fully transparent and package integrity can be verified
using the checksums displayed in the GitHub Actions build logs.

Verify a downloaded package against the log:
$ sha256sum librewolf-<version>_<revision>.<arch>.xbps

This manual check is necessary for integrity as GitHub Releases are mutable.
